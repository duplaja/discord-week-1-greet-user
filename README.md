# discord-week-1-greet-user
Discord Week 1 Challenge, to make a user feel welcome when they first log in.

## Purpose
This is more of a demo as to what can be done. I tried to follow best practices as much as possible for a functionally programmed WordPress plugin (minus the user of wp_footer instead of enqueing the JS), and also tried to comment functionality. If you have questions on any of the portions, please don't hesitate to ask!
